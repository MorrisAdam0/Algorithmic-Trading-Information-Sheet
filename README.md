# Algorithmic-Trading-Information-Sheet
## Background
This repsoitory aims to highlight different areas of algorithmic trading from statistical fundamentals to common trading strategies, as well as data visualisation using a variety of python libraries including matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly. 

The work is purely self taught and is simply to showcase the power of python in obtaining data and manipulating it - it is not financial advice!
